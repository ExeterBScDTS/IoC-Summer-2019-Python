# Next steps in Python

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used by programmers to ease the process of developing software.

### How to choose?

If you're working with programmers who have standardized on a particular IDE then the decision has been made for you.  If you're working on your own but have access to other programmers then it's worth asking what they use and consider using the same, as it could make your life easier when you need help.

### What do I use?

I use Visual Studio Code and I'm very happy with it, but my work probably isn't like yours.  I write programs in several programming languages, use GitHub a lot, and have students who need an easy to install development environment that doesn't require a super expensive
laptop.

If you're an aspiring data scientist then I suggest you try Spyder.  Or if you just want to learn a bit more Python, and perhaps share your learning with others, then maybe Thonny is right for you.
