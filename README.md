# IoC-Summer-2019-Python

## Institute of Coding Summer School - University of Exeter - 2019 - Python

Teaching resources for a one week introduction to programming in Python for students with no previous programming experience.

This material was delivered to a class of 30 students, mostly humanities undergraduates. Over the week the content changes from lectures, to working in pairs through to a group project in teams of four or five on the last day.

Not all the material used is included in this first release, but I hope to add more soon.
