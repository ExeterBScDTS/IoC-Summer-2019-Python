Teaching resources for a one week introduction to programming in Python for students with no previous programming experience.

This course was delivered online for one week in June 2020. Over the week the content changes from lectures, to working in pairs through to a group project in teams of four or five on the last day.

Similar material was delivered to a class of 30 students, mostly humanities undergraduates, in 2019 on campus.
